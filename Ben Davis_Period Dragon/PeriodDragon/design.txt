Game design
-----------

Game consists of multiple tile map layers. Each layer has a size w*h where w and h are prime numbers.
Each layer repeats seamlessly. As you move around, the layers scroll one tile each.
Parallax comes from the fact that the tiles are different sizes in different layers.

The game will come from the idea that the layers are not distinct but can interact in some way using their screen alignment.
So in order to define an interesting game, we will need to think about:
- tile types
- interactions between layers.


Tile types (with interaction notes inline)
------------------------------------------

Dragon - this is you.
	- You can move left/right/up/down
	- You are always in the middle of the screen - it scrolls as you move
	- You are simultaneously in all layers - you can only go where all layers are unobstructed. (I might change this if level design doesn't go well)

Diamonds - basic collectibles - you need all of these to complete a level

Brick walls - basic obstructions

Electrical tracks
	- various connection directions
	- terminals can be placed on tracks
	The terminals have to be roughly aligned for a connection to be made.
	If we define a terminal as occupying 1/2 the width of a tile,
	then there will usually be about one tile in the next layer through which a connection can be made.
	It might be nicer for terminals to be circular though.

Generators
	- these appear as faded diamonds
	- once a complete circuit has been made including a real diamond and a faded one, the faded one becomes real

Torches
	- Since you're a dragon - you can breathe fire on these to light them
	- Once they're lit, they can:
		- Burn coal to create diamonds
		- Burn holes in electrical tracks and stop them working
