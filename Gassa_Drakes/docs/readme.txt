The purpose of the game is to construct dragons.
Dragons can be made of bones, threads, bricks etc. 
To construct a dragon you have to use some pieces of material
(click on a pile of it). If the number of pieces in the pile is not prime, 
the material just disappears; 
you get score for it anyway.
Dragons breeze out flame that downgrades surrounding material.
Good luck!
