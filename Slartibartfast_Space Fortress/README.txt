Backstory
================================================================================
You are a renegade from the Dragon Clan of space fighters, fighting increasing numbers of your ex-clansmen as they try to bring you to justice for the crime of abandoning the clan (and also murdering your brother)
================================================================================

Running the game
================================================================================
The game takes a number as a commandline argument. If you don't give one you'll start at level 0.
If you give a prime number you will start at that level.
================================================================================

Instructions
================================================================================
In this game you play one spaceship fighting other spaceships, each round you face a prime number of enemy ships, and if you can defeat them you will face a stronger greater round.
The round number controls the strength of all ships (yours included) and the number and speed of your enemies.
Move: WASD/ UPDOWNLEFTRIGHT
Shoot: J/Spacebar

You ship is made of several turrets:
Shield Turrets - do nothing, absorbe damage well
Harpoon Turrets - fire harpoons. Harpoons are decent at piercing armor, move at a constant speed and are heavily effected by your speed when shooting
Cannonball Turrets - fire cannonballs. Cannonballs do a lot of damage, but aren't piercing and have a lower rate of fire. Cannonballs are barely effected by your speed when shooting, and they decelerate as they move.
================================================================================

Unimplemented features
================================================================================
* Editing your own ship instead of it being generated
* As enemy ships get stronger they also resemble the shapes of dragons
* Smarter "rounds", make it resemble shmups better
* Maybe make it an arena shooter instead?
* Better graphics
* Music
* SFX
